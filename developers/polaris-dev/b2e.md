## üßë‚Äçüíº Introduction to the Polaris B2E Model

Polaris' ‚ÄúBuilding to Earn‚Äù (B2E) model is a way to directly reward developers who contribute to enriching and expanding the Polaris ecosystem. This initiative not only seeks to motivate the active participation of developers, but also to foster a collaborative environment where technological advances are driven by the community.

***

## üìç Reasons and Objectives

The main objective of the B2E model is to encourage developers to constantly contribute code and improvements to the Polaris ecosystem, ensuring its growth and robustness. It also seeks to integrate the community by recognizing and compensating the efforts of those who dedicate time and skill to the development of the project. In this way, Polaris aims to build a solid and innovative technological ecosystem based on active collaboration.

### Members Involved

* **Equipo de Polaris:** Responsables de desarrollar el entorno base y de implementar los mecanismos necesarios para que el modelo B2E funcione eficazmente.
* **Developers:** Contribuyentes activos que dedican sus habilidades y tiempo al desarrollo y mejora del ecosistema de Polaris.
* **Donadores:** Miembros de la comunidad que decidan apoyar econ√≥micamente el proyecto, contribuyendo al <mark style="color:blue;">"Fondo de desarrollo"</mark> destinado a financiar a los desarrolladores.

### Continuity Incentives

To ensure the viability and attractiveness of the B2E model, Polaris will establish several incentives:

1. **Taxpayer Recognition:** The platform will highlight major contributors, providing visibility and recognition for their work within the community.
2. **Development Fund:** A specific economic fund, <mark style="color:blue;">financed by donations from the community</mark>, will be created to compensate the work and effort of the developers.
3. <mark style="color:blue;">Exclusive Utilities for Donors:</mark> To encourage the community to actively participate in the financing of the <mark style="color:blue;">‚ÄúDevelopment Fund‚Äù</mark>, Polaris will create exclusive products and/or services for those who make donations.

The B2E model implemented by Polaris represents a way to encourage and maintain a sustainable development ecosystem, where members play key and complementary roles. Through the integration of <mark style="color:blue;">Polaris Team, Developers, and Donors, a virtuous circle</mark> is created that enhances the quality and growth of the project. The incentives designed, such as the recognition of contributions and the Development Fund, not only value the effort of the participants, but also promote the inclusion of new talents and the active investment of the community.
