Qsoft is a team formed by 4 Cuban software developers who tried to <mark style="color:yellow;">create</mark> a light in the middle of an ocean of darkness.

### The beginnings of the team

Forced to look for a source of income that would facilitate the acquisition of resources, the team members<mark style="color:yellow;">, even without knowing each other,</mark> decided at an early age to enter the technological world. A sector that at that time was in constant evolution but that everyone in a certain way loved all the paradigms that each technological advance provoked.

After approximately 4_years_of independent study, the group of developers decided to get together as a <mark style="color:yellow;">team</mark> to try to create that ray of light and try, perhaps, to enlighten other Cuban and world developers.

### Qsoft's evolution over time.

And after several talks and meetings, the newly created software creation and development team, initially called "<mark style="color:yellow;">Programming Team</mark>" thought to be focused on the creation of basic web pages. It decided to accept its first jobs.

In this way, little by little over time, and with the increasing amount of work that came to the team, they were learning new technologies. To the point of becoming <mark style="color:yellow;">specialists in the creation of multiplatform applications</mark> and having a high control in the creation of complex web applications. This in turn opened up new employment possibilities and above all, the possibility of creating their first product.

### What does the future hold for Qsoft ?

Currently the team is in the process of completing the development of its first product, <mark style="color:yellow;">Polaris</mark>. An <mark style="color:yellow;">ecosystem of utilities</mark> for the Web3 community with the objective of boosting its main business model, the sale of services as software creators and developers.
