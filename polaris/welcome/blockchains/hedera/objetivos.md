We selected <mark style="color:yellow;">Hedera</mark> as our parent Blockchain because we believe it presents the most <mark style="color:yellow;">revolutionary technology</mark> so far within the Web3 ecosystem. Supporting more than 10,000 transactions per second and with an average transaction cost of <mark style="color:yellow;">$0.0001</mark>, it is, without a doubt, <mark style="color:yellow;">the most revolutionary Blockchain in the Web3 ecosystem right now</mark>. In addition to being backed by several multinational companies, it can guarantee the security and scalability of the network in the very long term.

### The main problem of Hedera

But like all <mark style="color:yellow;">technological revolution</mark> also presents several <mark style="color:red;">problems</mark> within it. And the main one of them is the difficulty in its adoption due to its technology. Hedera presents a very <mark style="color:yellow;">complex technology</mark> and difficult to understand for an average user who has little knowledge about Web3. Therefore we decided that our main mission within the network will be to develop <mark style="color:yellow;">tools</mark> to give old and new users of the network access to information in an <mark style="color:yellow;">easy</mark>, <mark style="color:yellow;">fast</mark> and <mark style="color:yellow;">convenient</mark> way.
