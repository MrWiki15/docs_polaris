# Polaris Bots

BOT (PREALPHA)
{% endembed %}

The Polaris Discord bot was initially created with the goal of being a powerful extension of the ecosystem, designed to facilitate interaction and provide useful tools within the Web3 community. Conceived with a focus on accessibility, usability and community participation.

But as time went by we added more and more functionalities to the bot, to the point that maintaining everything became almost impossible.

So instead of having all the functionalities in a single application, we decided that each functionality should have its own independent app.
