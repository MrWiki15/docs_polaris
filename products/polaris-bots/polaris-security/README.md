{% hint style="info" %}
Polaris Security is the main verification bot of our Discord server. It is in charge of managing user roles
{% endhint %}

> When the user logs into the server for the first time, he is greeted by a message from the bot saying that in order to verify himself he must first go through a few simple steps.

> Once the user presses the verification button, the bot sends a captcha that must be completed privately.

> In the private message, the bot sends you a randomly generated image to which other bots cannot reply or interact.

> Once the user enters the CAPTCHA code correctly, the bot will grant him the verification role and he will be able to access the other channels.
